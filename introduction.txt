Which field of IT (front-end, backend, AI-AR, BA, QA, Web Designer, etc... ):- BA
Why did you choose this field (at least 100 chars)? 
Answer : I choose Business Analyst as my domain because after getting to know more details about this domain, I felt like this is something I can work with. One of the main reason about this choice is my Communication, as it is one of the main requirement in BA. Managing skills and documentation skills are also the reason behind choosing this domain.
Where do you want to yourself in 5 years?
Answer : After 5 years, I will be looking to get more and more knowledge in this BA domain. After that i'll be looking for a bit stability in life. Also I will be looking to help my father in the best possible way I can.
